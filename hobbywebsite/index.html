   <h2>What is rock climbing? </h2> 
   <p>Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, across, or down natural rock formations. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. Knowledge of proper climbing techniques and the use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes. Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines, such as scrambling, bouldering, sport climbing, and traditional. Rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the least amount of attempts or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Indoor rock climbing is typically split into three disciplines: bouldering, lead climbing, and top roping.</p>

    <h2>Here is a list of the <strong>best</strong> three rock climbers in history</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Jim Bridwell</li>   
        <li>Warren Harding</li>
        <li>Lynn Hill</li>  
    </ol>
    <P>Jim Bridwell was a masterful climber with a visionary ability to pick out a seemingly impossible line and establish a route on it. Most of his climbs were done before free climbing gained popularity, so his reign as Yosemite Kingpin consisted of one insanely challenging aid climb after another, each of them pushing the limits of what was seen to be humanly possible. Bridwell introduced the world to do or die pitches and a style of climbing that demanded that you complete the pitch you are on or risk your life in a fall. Some of these climbs remain test pieces to this day.</p>
    <p>Harding was a monumental climber  and he set the two most important first ascents in the history of the sport: the Nose and the Dawn Wall, both of which Harding completed despite every other climber on the planet telling him that they were impossible. His sheer willingness and determination to throw himself at projects, such as spending 18 months working on the Nose, or hanging from a sleeping bag for 23 days on the dawn wall, is what distinguished him from every other climber of his generation (including Royal Robbins), and it earns him the number two spot on this list.</p>
    <p>Hill is one of the best climbers in history, and her dominance over the sport spanned multiple decades and led to some of the most impressive ascents by any climber, ever. She made a name for herself as a sport and competition climber. It was then that her rivalry with Catherine Destivelle really kicked off, and the two of them began to push each other to new heights. During this period, Hill claimed 30 world cup climbing titles and became the first woman to ever send a 5.14 route.</p>
