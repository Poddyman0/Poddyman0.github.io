        description: `This project is a simple informational website built using Node.js. The website contains four static pages: an index page, an about page, a contact page, and a custom 404 error page. The purpose of this project is to practice setting up a basic Node.js server and routing requests to serve different HTML files based on the URL path. The website runs locally on localhost:8080 and handles routing for each of the pages, with a fallback to the 404 page if a user tries to access a non-existent route.

        Technologies and Skills Used:
        Node.js: The core technology used to create the server and manage routing logic.
        JavaScript (ES6): Used to handle server logic and routing for different URL paths.
        HTML5: Each page (index, about, contact-me, and 404) is a simple HTML file with basic structure and content.
        HTTP Module (Node.js): The built-in HTTP module is used to create the server and listen for incoming requests.
        File System (fs) Module (Node.js): Utilized to read and serve the content of the HTML files dynamically based on the requested URL.
        Error Handling: Implemented custom routing logic to display a 404 page when the user navigates to a non-existent URL.

        Features:
        Simple Node.js Server: A Node.js server is set up using the HTTP module, listening on port 8080. The server handles incoming requests and serves the appropriate HTML file based on the URL path.

        Routing Logic: The server routes users to different pages based on the URL:
        localhost:8080/ serves the index.HTML page.
        localhost:8080/about serves the about.HTML page.
        localhost:8080/contact-me serves the contact-me.HTML page.
        Any URL that does not match the above routes triggers the 404.HTML page.
        Static HTML Pages: Each page is a basic HTML file with minimal content. The focus was on building the routing and server logic rather than the design and content.
        The 404.HTML page provides a simple error message informing users that the requested page was not found.

        Custom 404 Page Handling: Implemented custom logic in the server to check if the requested URL matches one of the predefined paths. If not, it serves the 404 page.

        File System Integration: The server uses Node.js\'s fs module to read the content of each HTML file and respond with it when the corresponding route is requested.

        Modular and Scalable Code: The code is structured to be easily extendable, allowing for additional pages and routes to be added in the future without major changes.`,

Best Score: The highest score achieved during gameplay is tracked and displayed. Card Management: Randomization: Cards are shuffled and displayed in a random order each time the game starts or the component mounts. Card Data: Card images and texts are fetched from an external API, like Giphy for animated images or a Pokémon API for themed images. Components and Structure: App Component: Manages the overall game logic, state, and card shuffling. Card Component: Represents individual cards, handles click events, and displays content. Scoreboard Component: Displays the current score and best score. API Service: Fetches card data from an external API. Styling: Visual Appeal: The game is styled for a visually engaging experience, with attention to card designs, layout, and overall aesthetics.
